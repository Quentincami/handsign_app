This project is a follow up from this one : https://github.com/lilianbchr/hand_gestures_categorization, which was a categorization project on different hand signs. I decided to go from this and develop an object recognition project, designed to recognize hand signs from a live feed, like a webcam. I fine tuned a Yolov8 model with homemade images that were pre processed to had diversity.
The first version of the app can be find here : https://handsignapp.streamlit.app/
The first version was working well, but my training wasn't sufficient and diversified, so I'm trying to work on that.
